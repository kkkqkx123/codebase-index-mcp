## Technical Implementation Details

### Type Safety
- Updated type definitions in `frontend/types/dashboard.types.ts`
- Integrated with existing API types from `frontend/types/api.types.ts`
- Ensured type consistency across components

### Styling System
- Created modular CSS for each component
- Implemented responsive design patterns
- Added dark mode support
- Included accessibility improvements

### State Management
- Used React hooks for local state management
- Implemented localStorage for dashboard configuration
- Added proper error handling and loading states

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `frontend/__tests__/dashboard.test.tsx`
- Covered all major component functionality
- Included integration tests for component interaction

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### Services Integration
- ✅ Uses existing `monitoring.service.ts` for health and metrics
- ✅ Leverages `api.service.ts` for HTTP communication
- ✅ Integrates with backend proxy endpoints as specified

### Component Reuse
- ✅ Uses existing common components (Card, Button, LoadingSpinner, etc.)
- ✅ Follows established component patterns
- ✅ Maintains consistent styling with design system

### Navigation Integration
- ✅ Updated `App.tsx` to use new Dashboard component
- ✅ Integrated with React Router for navigation
- ✅ Added quick action buttons for other sections

## Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Rendering
- Implemented proper React.memo usage where beneficial
- Used efficient state update patterns
- Minimized unnecessary re-renders

### Data Fetching
- Configurable refresh intervals
- Proper error handling and retry mechanisms
- Efficient API calls with caching considerations

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Optimized layouts for different screen sizes
- Performance-conscious CSS animations

## Accessibility Features

### WCAG Compliance
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ Proper ARIA labels and roles
- ✅ Color contrast compliance
