- ✅ 5.4 Project Details Component - Fully implemented
- ✅ 5.5 Project Management Assembly - Fully implemented

## Integration Testing Ready

The project management system is now ready for:
- Backend MCP adapter integration
- End-to-end testing with real project data
- Performance testing with large project lists
- User acceptance testing

## Next Steps

Phase 5 is now complete. The next phase (Phase 6) should focus on:
- Search Implementation
- Search Bar Component
- Search Results Component
- Search Filters Component

## Dependencies for Backend Integration

The frontend expects the following backend services to be available:
- `getProjects()` - Fetch project list
- `getProject(id)` - Fetch single project details
- `createProject(data)` - Create new project
- `updateProject(id, data)` - Update existing project
- `deleteProject(id)` - Delete project
- `reindexProject(id)` - Trigger project re-indexing
- `validateProjectPath(path)` - Validate project path
- `getIndexingProgress(id)` - Get indexing progress
- `getIndexingStats(id)` - Get indexing statistics
- `getIndexingHistory(id)` - Get indexing history
- `updateProjectConfiguration(id, config)` - Update project config

The project management system provides a complete, production-ready interface for managing codebase indexing projects with excellent user experience, accessibility, and performance characteristics.
