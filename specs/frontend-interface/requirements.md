# Frontend Interface Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple frontend interface for the Codebase Index MCP service. The frontend will provide a web-based interface for debugging existing functionality and serve as a foundation for future natural language query capabilities. The interface will be designed to be extensible and maintainable, following the existing project's architecture patterns.
