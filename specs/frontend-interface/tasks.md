# Frontend Interface Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive, actionable checklist for building the frontend interface for the Codebase Index MCP service. The plan is organized in phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to ensure incremental progress and early validation of core functionality.

Based on the analysis, significant architectural adjustments are required to align the frontend with the existing MCP service architecture. The plan has been updated to include the necessary HTTP-to-MCP adapter layer, authentication system, and secure monitoring integration.
