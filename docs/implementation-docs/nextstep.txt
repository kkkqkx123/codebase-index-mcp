● Based on my systematic analysis and attempts to fix the dependency injection issues, I've discovered that this codebase has extensive and fundamental problems with its
  InversifyJS dependency injection setup. Here's a comprehensive summary of what I found and what needs to be done:

  Issues Found and Fixed

  ✅ Successfully Fixed:

  1. BatchPerformanceMonitor - Fixed direct injection of ConfigService and LoggerService to use TYPES symbols
  2. SemgrepMetricsService - Fixed LoggerService injection to use TYPES.LoggerService
  3. HealthCheckService - Fixed both ConfigService and LoggerService injections
  4. SnippetController - Fixed ConfigService and StorageCoordinator injections
  5. NebulaSpaceManager - Fixed ErrorHandlerService and ConfigService injections
  6. Added missing bindings - SnippetExtractionRules and NebulaSpaceManager
  7. GraphPersistenceService - Fixed multiple direct injection issues

  ❌ Systematic Issues Identified:

  Through the Task agent analysis, I identified 60+ dependency injection issues across the codebase, including:

  1. Wrong injection patterns - Direct class names instead of TYPES symbols (40+ files)
  2. Missing DI bindings - 20+ TYPES symbols defined but not bound
  3. Missing imports - 15+ @injectable classes not imported in DIContainer.ts
  4. String-based injections - Several services using string literals instead of TYPES

  Current Status

  The application cannot start due to extensive dependency injection issues. The problems are:

  1. Cascading dependencies - Many services depend on each other in complex ways
  2. Inconsistent injection patterns - Mix of direct class injection, TYPES symbols, and string-based injection
  3. Missing infrastructure - Many core services are not properly bound or have wrong injection patterns

  Recommended Next Steps

  To get the application running, a comprehensive fix is needed:

  Phase 1: Core Services (Priority)

  1. Fix all core service injections (ConfigService, LoggerService, ErrorHandlerService)
  2. Add missing DI container bindings for essential services
  3. Fix critical path services (IndexService, ParserService, etc.)

  Phase 2: Database Services

  1. Fix all graph storage service injections
  2. Add missing graph-related bindings
  3. Resolve database service dependencies

  Phase 3: Monitoring and Advanced Services

  1. Fix Prometheus metrics conflicts
  2. Enable monitoring services
  3. Fix remaining advanced service injections

  Technical Approach

  The fixes needed are:
  - Replace @inject(ServiceName) with @inject(TYPES.ServiceName)
  - Add missing imports and bindings in DIContainer.ts
  - Convert string-based injections to TYPES symbols
  - Resolve circular dependencies between services

  This is a significant refactoring task that requires systematic work across the entire codebase. The application architecture is fundamentally sound, but the dependency     
  injection setup needs comprehensive repair to function properly.
