Based on my analysis of the monitoring setup in both the documentation (`docs/docker/monitoring/`) and the actual implementation (`monitoring/`), here's my assessment:

## Are all 3 modules currently used necessary?

**Yes, all three modules (Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana) are necessary** for a complete monitoring solution:

1. **Prometheus**: Essential for metrics collection and querying. It scrapes metrics from your services (codebase-index-mcp, qdrant, nebula-graph) and evaluates alert rules.

2. **Alertmanager**: Necessary for handling alerts generated by Prometheus. It handles deduplication, grouping, and routing of alerts to correct receivers (Slack, PagerDuty).

3. **Grafana**: Critical for visualization of metrics through dashboards. It provides the UI for monitoring and analysis.

The current setup shows a well-structured monitoring stack:
- Prometheus collects metrics from your services
- Alert rules are defined for critical system events
- Alertmanager handles notification routing
- Grafana provides visualization through dashboards
