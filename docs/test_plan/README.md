**Comprehensive Test Plan**
- Overall testing strategy and objectives
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing approaches
- Testing tools and frameworks
- Quality gates and metrics
- Continuous integration setup

### [MODULE_TEST_PLAN.md](MODULE_TEST_PLAN.md)
**Module-Specific Test Plan**
- Detailed testing requirements for each module
- Specific test cases and coverage requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- Test data requirements

### [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
**Test Implementation Plan**
- Timeline and resource allocation
- Phase-by-phase implementation approach
- Milestones and deliverables
- Risk management strategies

## 🎯 Testing Objectives

1. **Code Quality**: Ensure all modules meet quality standards with >95% test coverage
2. **Reliability**: Verify system stability under various conditions
3. **Performance**: Validate response times and throughput meet targets
4. **Compatibility**: Confirm compatibility with all supported databases and embedding providers
5. **Security**: Ensure proper error handling and data protection

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Overview

### Unit Testing
- Focus on individual components in isolation
- Use mocks for dependencies to ensure fast, reliable testing
- Target 100% coverage for all modules

### Integration Testing
- Verify interactions between components and with external systems
- Test database integration, embedding services, and file system operations
- Validate cross-service synchronization and consistency

### End-to-End Testing
- Simulate real-world usage scenarios
- Test complete workflows from file indexing to search and analysis
- Validate error recovery and system resilience

## 📊 Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage for all modules
- **Integration Tests**: 90% coverage for service interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: 85% coverage for user workflows

## 🛠️ Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Primary testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **Test Containers**: For database testing (Qdrant, NebulaGraph)
- **Artillery**: For performance and load testing
- **ESLint/Prettier**: For code quality assurance
- **Istanbul**: For code coverage analysis

## 📅 Implementation Timeline

The testing implementation follows a 10-week timeline:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Unit Testing Foundation
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Integration Testing
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Search and Graph Integration
4. **Weeks 7-8**: End-to-End Testing
5. **Weeks 9-10**: Performance and Security Testing

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: >95% code coverage across all modules
- **Test Pass Rate**: >99% test pass rate in CI/CD
- **Performance**: All operations meet defined performance targets
- **Security**: No critical security vulnerabilities identified
