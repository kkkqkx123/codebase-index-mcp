# Advanced Reranking Features

This document describes the advanced reranking features implemented for the Codebase Index MCP Service.

## Overview

The advanced reranking system improves search result quality through multi-stage processing, machine learning enhancement, and real-time learning capabilities. The system consists of several components working together to provide highly relevant search results.

## Multi-Stage Reranking System

The reranking system implements a multi-stage approach to improve result relevance:

### Components

1. **Semantic Reranking Module**: Enhances results based on semantic similarity between query and content
2. **Graph Relationship Enhancer**: Improves results by leveraging codebase graph relationships
3. **Code Feature Optimizer**: Optimizes results based on code structure and metadata
4. **Reranking Pipeline Coordinator**: Orchestrates the reranking process
5. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment System**: Adjusts component weights based on performance

### Strategies

The system supports multiple reranking strategies:
- **Semantic**: Focuses on semantic similarity
- **Graph**: Leverages graph relationships
- **Hybrid**: Combines multiple approaches (default)
- **ML**: Uses machine learning models

## Similarity Algorithm Suite

A comprehensive set of similarity algorithms is implemented:

### Vector Similarity
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors
- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance
- **Dot Product Similarity**: Measures vector alignment

### Structural Similarity
